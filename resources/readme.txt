This is a folder to contain the two XML files which the schematron rules uses:
* d4.xml - our own implementation of the list INSPIRE default CRS codes, opened as $defaultCRScodes in GEMINI_2.3_Schematron_Schema-v1.0.sch
* MD_CharacterSetCode.xml - an extract from the TC211 code list dictionary at opened as $charSetCodes in GEMINI_2.3_Schematron_Schema-v1.0.sch
You could adjust your copy of the Schematron file to reference them from here, or download them & reference them locally on your system
Up to April 2021, and for a period of overlap, these files are also available at https://www.agi.org.uk/images/xslt/
